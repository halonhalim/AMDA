                        One important theme of the 21st century is "coexistence of diversity" or how different cultures and ways of thinking can coexist throughout the world. AMDA believes that the keywords of this concept of coexistence in diversity are "respect" and "trust". Through humanitarian and developmental activities, AMDA feels it is imperative to work towards building "a global network of partnership for peace through projects with the spirit of 'sogo fujo' (mutual assistance) under local initiatives." AMDA defines peace as a situation in which any family can fulfill their basic life needs today and can hope for a decent life tomorrow. Factors that serve as obstacles to peace in this sense include war, disaster, and poverty. AMDA believes that it is through cooperation in implementing projects designed to alleviate and remove such obstacles that we can truly gain "respect" and "trust".
