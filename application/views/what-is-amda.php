                        The Association of Medical Doctors of Asia (AMDA) is a humanitarian, non-profit, non-political, non-sectarian, and non-governmental organization formally established in 1984. AMDA's headquarters is in Okayama City, Japan, and it has thirty chapters as partners worldwide. It's vision is global peace and development, and it's mission is to promote the health and well-being of underprivileged and marginalized people in Asia and other continents. These principles are embodied in its slogan "Better Quality of Life for a Better Future". AMDA views itself as an active network, which builds respect and trust through partnerships in humanitarian activities. Throughout its existence, AMDA has made earnest efforts in pursuing and achieving its aims and objectives. AMDA recognizes three main obstacles to improving the quality of life of underprivileged and marginalized people — war, natural disaster, and poverty — and AMDA projects seek to overcome these obstacles. In 1995, AMDA was granted Consultative Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
