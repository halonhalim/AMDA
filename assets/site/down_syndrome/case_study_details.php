                            A child of Bangladeshi descent born with Down syndrome. <br>

                            10, August 2008 a child was born who would forever change the lives of a single family. Already a proud father of two sons,
                            father Sarder A. Razzak awaited the arrival of his third son, S. Rafan Razzak. His name chosen from the meaning of graceful,
                            at the time it was unknown that Rafan was born with Down syndrome. What Razzak observed during the time of Rafan’s birth he
                            noticed that Rafan was quite fair and physically softer and gentler than many other infants. With noticing the same observations,
                            Dr. KaziNaushad-Un-Nabi recommended few tests to be completed in the New Born Intensive Care facility and be given special support
                            to strengthen his physical support. While in the New Born Intensive Care unit of Japan Bangladesh Friendship Hospital, Dr. Nabi began
                            to observe further differences between Rafan and other infants was that he did not have the similar movements of the majority of
                            individual babies. From this, the Doctor recommended that a chromosome test be performed; the results showed that the Rafan had
                            the trisomy 21 gene, meaning that he has an extra chromosome in comparison to the majority of individuals.<br>
                            “Seeing Rafan, he seemed very typical, at the time seeing Rafan I wanted to know what Down syndrome was. Seeing Rafan
                            I just wanted to know something from Doctors, the Doctors told me that it was a genetic problem. Seeing Rafan they told
                            me that I don’t have to worry, because seeing Rafan he was in good health, many children with Down Syndrome have many health
                            difficulties, the only difference is that Rafan’s development will be slightly delayed in comparison to other children, so
                            I wouldn’t have to worry too much, I would just have to take care of him. I didn’t want to stop there; I wanted to learn more,
                            so I began to search, what is Down syndrome, what are the symptoms of Down syndrome. First I just began to learn abouwhat Down
                            syndrome is. Seeing Rafan’s growth, I began to advocate myself to see the positive effects. I began learning the Down syndrome
                            issues related to, health, mental, education. Then I tried to know about what type of support can be given to these children,
                            how the world views this. Are thereorganizations that are involved in advocating the rights or awareness of children and began
                            writing the different organizations. I began to get great responses from global connections and the National Down syndrome society,
                            Down Syndrome International, Australia, South Africa, as much as I could.
                            Through the support and understanding of these global organizations, Sarder A. Razzak realized that there are many be a minority
                            of parents in Bangladesh who may be or may have been in a similar situation as him, but did not have the resources or intentions
                            to find the support that he sought. In a socio-culture society where birth differences are perceived as a negative entity, Sarder
                            A. Razzak took on the challenge of changing the socio-cultural norms of the nation of Bangladesh. His vision, to create a nation
                            in which Rafan is accepted and acknowledged of his individual talents that he offers to our society, he hopes to create a society
                            in which children born with Down syndrome are understood by their parents and others. The needs of children of Down syndrome differ
                            from many children, as part of the social development Bangladesh; it is not only the parents, but families, friends, and community
                            who enclose a need for education and awareness. The Razzak family was blessed with a child such as Rafan, a talented young boy who
                            brightens the day and brings a smile to his family. Just as Rafan has changed his family’s life especially the life of his father
                            through understanding and hope, Sarder A. Razzak hopes that one day the nation of Bangladesh will acknowledge the talents that each
                            individual child brings to the nation of Bangladesh, especially the children who have a different sort of individuality.<br>
                            “Rafan, he likes to make a lot of fun, he likes to have fun. Sometimes he throws something out the window at home, we ask him
                            why did you throw your toy? His answer, ‘well if I don’tthrow the toy, then Halima won’t go down, and then I will not be able to
                            go down.” Said Rafan’s father.
